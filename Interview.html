							<h3>Who is Megan Crawley</h3>
								<p>Megan Crawley is a Software Developer at BHP in Perth, Western Australia. <br>
								We chose Megan Crawley because she has an extensive career history, knowledge and experience within IT, and she was very supportive in sharing her knowledge and experience with our team.</p>

							<h3>How does Megan’s IT experience come into play as a Software Developer at BHP?</h3>
								<p>Megan’s current IT role within BHP mainly consists of work in the development of web applications which is full stack development that she develops from a database. “Stack development includes the back end, that has your API’s and processing data, and front end which is all about visualising the data”, she explained. Systems that she deals with at BHP mainly relate to scheduling and with a focus on iron ore, sometimes she also works on other assets within the company. <br>
								Scheduling is such a large part of her scope of works that her team must break it up into smaller chunks, “so you have different scheduling systems for different parts of the supply chain”. She explained.</p>

							<h3>What kind of Industry does Megan work in and how does her IT role come into play within that Industry?</h3>
								<p>Megan works in the Mining Industry and normally what happens is you have a lot of available resource and you have a lot of demand as well and it's all about making that a more efficient process so often the role that technology plays in a resources company is saving time and money and maybe also actually most importantly making things safer for people, so if you look at that from a scheduling perspective you make sure that nothing in the schedule is going to put people in harm's way, equipment isn’t going to collide or go to the wrong location and everything is a lot more organised.</p>

							<h3>What were some of Megan’s previous roles, what were they like? </h3>
								<p>She started her technology career at much smaller company, Metisc which is kind of like a Microsoft shop so they kind of produce add-ons and manage subscriptions for a piece of software called Microsoft dynamics it’s a CRM system, not very interesting from Megan’s perspective but a lot of small business use it to manage their customers, stock and business in general, that is where she started. She is still working with a lot of web apps and integrating them with Microsoft dynamics and she mentions that at BHP she has been in the same role nearly the whole time she has been there or at least done similar tasks with just different titles, so she has always worked in some form of web apps development and always with the intention of scheduling, its just the technologies that have changed and the different data that her/her team might be consuming has changed over time, she wouldn’t say she has covered any other roles specifically. She did do a small circumvent where she worked more on the planning side, where she planned what technology projects she would like to do in the future and more importantly to make sure that they are aligned with the direction of where the business is heading and what needs the customers will have in the future. <br>
								She mentions she had a bit of luck along the way.</p>

							<h3>Who are all the different people Megan interacts with, within her team at work? </h3>
								<p>Within her team she interacts with project managers daily because they manage the work she does, she also interacts with people we call business analysts, “they are often the people that drive the requirements and specifications for the software that you develop and then on the other end of that we also work with testers who are responsible for testing the products that she codes”, she explained. So that’s a very small reflection of what a software team looked like at her previous company Metisc, very similar to her environment today but on a much smaller scale. In terms of people that she might interact with outside of IT the main group would be customers. So, from a perspective from Metisc her customers were actually small business in Perth or even individuals that wanted websites build whereas at BHP her customer is BHP, it is just a different team within BHP that consumes her product. “So really if you look at who she interacts with from a more general perspective, you need to interact with whoever is paying for the product and who is using the product”, She mentioned. <br>
								Other interactions she has on a regular basis is other teams that build systems that she might either consume data from or send data to in the future because she has a lot of different systems that must interact with each other, so you must make sure you work with those teams to make sure that your aligned when your sending data between them.</p>

							<h3>Does Megan often work with other IT professionals or collaborate on projects outside of work, like a personal project for example?</h3>
								<p>Megan mentions that she is guilty of not doing a lot of personal projects because she already works a lot of hours and she doesn’t like taking it home, more in the UX base she has been collaborating with people outside of BHP on a more social basis and its more about sharing ideas or tools that you might use. <br>
								Megan discusses meet up groups to sign up to and join events in CBD’s and often after work she would go to a meet up event and it would cover a variety of different topics, the last event she went to was focused on ‘User experience and Virtual gaming’ and previous meet ups have been more tailored to the age group you're in or the part of the career that you're in. She also compares what tools she might use, sometimes she goes to events that are hosted by tech companies such as Microsoft or google where they run events and they might market a product they have released, and she could possibly use or learn something about it from attending the event. <br>
								When Megan was a graduate, she went to a meet up to see how people were getting exp and training and said it was very helpful. <br>
								Because IT people normally prefer to be on our computers and be introverted it's easy to just hop online and join a chat forum and learn a lot of things about IT that way. <br>
								Megan found that she’s a bit of an anomaly in the industry, she doesn’t do a lot of her own projects, she doesn’t really like talking about work outside of work but she knows a lot of developers that do projects all the time and experiment with different technology so she highly recommends we have some projects we do for ourselves, not for a customer but to have a goal for a project and to produce something because when it comes to an interview or networking it's always good to say, “oh I've actually built this or that and it does this and that” and it also helps you learn better.
								</p>

							<h3>Does Megan have many interactions with clients or investors? </h3>
								<p>She interacts with internal employees within BHP, if we break it down, she interacts with her end users and end users could be people on work, on site, work in the office, people might also work in a different city, she did a lot of work for the East Coast team within BHP a couple of years ago, her end users were in Brisbane and on some of BHP’s mine sites across Queensland. <br>
								In terms of an investor perspective the equivalent at bhp would be whatever chain is funding the project, “so you need to take into consideration what outcomes they would like from the project and as well as what the users would like from the project you are working on because they are not always aligned”, Megan explained.
								</p>

							<h3>What aspects of Megan’s work does she spend most of her time on</h3>
								<p>“Probably meetings”, she said, as we all sat there wondering if she was talking about us. <br>
								For her traditional role where she was working as a junior software developer the most amount of her time would be spent on google. “Normally when you do programming at Uni, they kind of make it seem like everything is out of a textbook and you go to the textbook and then at work everything is identical. It's not really that way anymore there's so many different technologies you could never possibly come prepared for all of them.” Megan explained. So, she spends most of her time researching solutions to problems on the internet, reading documentations, reading online forums and chatting to other developers about solutions to problems she has. The rest of her time in software development would be spent in implementing those. And “as you gain more experience as a software developer you start to have to go to a lot more meetings because you're touching on a lot more products and influence design decisions as well”, she mentioned.</p>

							<h3>Which aspects of Megan’s work does she find most challenging?</h3>
								<p>“Probably the above, coincidently it’s what I spend most of my time doing”, she said. It’s the fact that tech is constantly changing so she can never just go and code something she always needs to look at the reference document or look at what's changed for example she used a programming framework called angular, quite a lot in her current and previous jobs and that framework actually upgrades every 6 months and sometimes those upgrades are breaking changes so she has to relearn how to do things so she finds that quite frustrating but that’s something you have to get used to if you want to work in IT, it's never going to stay the same. <br>
								“There is always someone out there that has had the same problems as you and if you can't find someone then you need to find a new solution” explained Megan.</p>

							<h3>We asked Megan for an example of the work she does that best captures the essence of the IT industry and her thoughts on what the future holds?</h3>
								<p>In general she thinks that everyone is interested in automation, AI, machine learning and all the buzzwords people like to throw out there related to those areas, often you'll find that stake holders or clients like to request for things to be more automated or just make their lives a bit easier so she thinks in general the industry is moving towards the removal of repetitive tasks and where possible using Ai or machine learning to make more intelligent decisions in whatever industry its relevant to, it's not specific to mining, she thinks the other thing the tech industry is moving towards is a more community based practice, “so there's already a lot of open source software available out there and people are really happy to share their code and I thinks it's about sharing what people have already created and re using it as opposed to everyone working in secret and no one sharing their solutions” Megan said. <br>
								She believes the big thing in IT at the moment is cloud computing and more specifically within business.</p>

							<h3>Who would win in a fight: A horse sized duck, or 100 duck sized horses?</h3>
								<p>Megan obviously had some pre-preparation time for this one as she spoke quite confidently in saying, “100 duck sized horses would obviously win”.</p>

							<h3>How many hours does Megan put in a week?</h3>
								<p>Her company is very flexible, and they have strict fatigue policies. It depends on projects, but she normally works 8 hours in the office during the day. It is part of her health and safety policy at work that she can’t work too many hours. <br>
								She suggested that while we are studying and learning we should do a lot of courses, learning, training, certifications etc.</p>

							<h3>Where is everyone she works with located, does she work with remote workers?</h3>
								<p>Her last manager was in Singapore, some managers are in America. When she did a project that was based in Brisbane and spanned over 12+ months, she only went to Queensland twice in that year. <br>
								She does a lot of remote working. Her company promotes enterprise mobility, working from home and or office.</p>

							<h3>Does Megan find that it changes things within her work environment in regards to her work colleagues being remote workers in Singapore or America?</h3>
								<p>She believes Covid has helped because “people had to find new ways of working together, post last year everyone has adapted quite well and it doesn’t really have an impact on the workplace other than a social aspect and most people want to come into work for a social life, rather than for work aspect they might go for drinks, coffee, or dinner after work hours”, she explained. The only challenge she thinks industry faces in general with remote working in her field is more around user experience and interaction with clients. <br>
								She was talking with someone from another company last year and she found it quite hard to interview end users and interact with them so they could show her how they currently use a system or watch their behaviour when interacting with a screen from a UX perspective. And the other thing is if you're introducing a new system to an end user and you want to train them or understand what you can do better from a user experience perspective that can be quite hard over a system like this especially if there are technical glitches and stuff like that, she thinks they are common challenges that everyone is facing now, but, “IT in general is one of the better suited careers if you enjoy working remotely”, Megan said.</p>
